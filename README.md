## The 3 most important facts about data scientists

The **[Stack Overflow's Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019)** is the largest survey where developers from all over the world answer questions about their jobs. I was curious if we could learn anything about the field of Data Science by taking a closer look at the responses.

### My main questions were:
- Which job titles are closest to the one of a `Data Scientist`?
- What tools are most important for `Data Scientists`?
- Are `Data Scientists` happier in their jobs than other developers?
